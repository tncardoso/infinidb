Infinidb is a proof-of-concept SQLite virtual table extension that generates data on the fly using OpenAI's GPT-4o. Instead of storing static data, Infinidb generates the schema and content of your tables based on their names and descriptions.

Need a table of "19th-century French poets"? Just ask. Need a database of "fictional starships"? It's there.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Schema Generation:** Automatically creates table structures (columns, types) based on your description.
*   **AI-Generated Content:** Populates tables with contextually relevant data generated by LLMs.
*   **SQLite Compatible:** Works as a standard SQLite virtual table, allowing you to use standard SQL queries (`SELECT`, `WHERE`, etc.).
*   **Caching:** Caches generated schemas and data locally to improve performance and reduce API costs.

## Prerequisites

*   Go 1.25 or higher
*   An OpenAI API Key

## Installation & Running

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Set your OpenAI API key:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
3.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    go run -tags "vtable" .
    ```

## Usage

Once the REPL is running, you can create virtual tables and query them.

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE [table_name] USING infinidb([table_name], "[description]");
```

### Examples

**1. Historical Figures**

Create a table of Roman Emperors:

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE emperors USING infinidb(emperors, "A list of Roman Emperors, their reign dates, and cause of death");
SELECT * FROM emperors;
```

**2. Fictional Data**

Generate a list of magical items:

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE magic_items USING infinidb(magic_items, "Rare magical items from Dungeons & Dragons, their rarity, and effect");
SELECT * FROM magic_items;
```

**3. Tech Products**

```sql
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE gpus USING infinidb(gpus, "NVIDIA GPUs released in the last 10 years with VRAM size");
SELECT * FROM gpus;
```

## Disclaimer

Infinidb is "unreliable" by design. The data is generated by an AI and may be factually incorrect, inconsistent, or just plain made up. Do not use for mission-critical applications or where factual accuracy is required.
